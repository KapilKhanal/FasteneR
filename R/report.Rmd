RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) analysis is a behavior based technique used to segment customers by examining their transaction history such as

- how recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- how often they purchase (frequency)
- how much the customer spends (monetary)
**It is based on the marketing axiom that 80% of your business comes from 20% of your customers**


```{r}
knitr::kable(params$df)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = collect(params$df),aes(x= CustomerID,y = recency,color = monetary)) + geom_point()
```
